# OpenLLMs: Less is More for Open-source Large Language Models

OpenLLMs is a series of open-source language models based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We release two versions ([v1](#v1) and [v2](#v2)) models. Specifically, v1 uses only ~6K GPT-4 conversations directly filtered from the ~90K ShareGPT conversations, while v2 adopts cleaned ~80k ShareGPT conversations with a conditioning strategy and weighted loss. Despite our methods being simple, OpenLLMs has demonstrated remarkable performance. Our final vision is to develop an open-source and commercially available large language model, and we are still moving on.

## News

- [2023/07/07] We released the [OpenLLMs_v2 model series](https://huggingface.co/openchat).

- [2023/07/01] We released the [OpenLLMs_v1 model series](https://huggingface.co/openchat).

## Models and Dataset

*‚ö†Ô∏è Note:* The evaluation metrics represent a quantified measure of a subset of the model's capabilities. A win-rate greater than 50% does not necessarily indicate that the model is better than ChatGPT in all scenarios or for all use cases. It is essential to consider the specific tasks or applications for which the model was evaluated and compare the results accordingly.

## Model Evaluation

We have evaluated our models using the three most popular evaluation benchmarks, including AlpacaEval, MT-bench, and Vicuna GPT-4 benchmarks. 
Here we list the minimal version of benchmarks with our released models. The full version can be found on [MT-bench](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard) and [AlpacaEval](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/).
It is worth noting that all the win-rate, including MT-bench, is computed without tie, e.g. ```win_rate = win / (win + loss)```.

## Weights & Serving

We provide full weights of all models as Hugging Face repos. You can use the following commands to start a local API server at `http://localhost:18888`. Please note that models should be used under their foundation models' license.

| Model         | Size | Context | Weights                                                                 | Serve                                                                                                      |
|---------------|------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenChat      | 13B  | 2048    | [openchat/openchat](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat)           | `python -m ochat.serving.openai_api_server --model_type openchat --model_path openchat/openchat`           |
| OpenChat8192  | 13B  | 8192    | [openchat/openchat_8192](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_8192) | `python -m ochat.serving.openai_api_server --model_type openchat_8192 --model_path openchat/openchat_8192` |

The server is compatible with the `ChatCompletions` protocol (please note that some functionalities are not fully supported) and the `openai` package. You can specify the server of `openai` package by setting:

```python
openai.api_base = "http://localhost:18888/v1"
```

The currently supported `ChatCompletions` arguments are:

| Name                 | Description                                                                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| conversation         | The conversation to complete. Example: ```[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]``` |
| temperature          | Temperature for sampling. Recommended: `0.7`                                        |
| top_p                | Top-P for sampling. Recommended: `0.9`                                              |
| max_generated_tokens | Maximum number of generated tokens                                                  |
| stream               | Response in event stream (true / false)                                             |

We also provide a **Web UI** for a better user experience, please refer to the following section for details.

*Note:* We recommend having a GPU with memory of at least 40GB (1x A100) to run the server.

## Web UI

You can interact with the model using [OpenChat-UI](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat-ui), which is a fork of Chatbot UI with support for OpenChat models.

To use OpenChat-UI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the OpenChat-UI repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat-ui.git
```

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Set the API host to the local server (or the address of the OpenChat server)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the OpenChat-UI repo with the following content:

```conf
OPENAI_API_HOST=http://localhost:18888
OPENAI_API_KEY=openchat-dummy-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

4. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Model modifications

We added an EOT (end-of-turn) token to every base model. For LLaMA models, the embedding of EOT is initialized as the average of all existing token embeddings. For StarCoder models, the embedding of EOT is randomly initialized with 0.02 standard deviation.

For LLaMA-based models with 8192 context, the `max_position_embeddings` was set to 8192, and RoPE codes were extrapolated. An attempt to interpolate the RoPE code was made, but it resulted in a significant drop in performance (~101% Vicuna GPT-4 evaluation) without mixing pretraining data.

## Dataset

**ü§ó Converted dataset available at [openchat_sharegpt4_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openchat/openchat_sharegpt4_dataset)**

The dataset used in the project is a cleaned and filtered version of ShareGPT, retaining only GPT-4 conversations. The original ShareGPT contained approximately 90K conversations, and only 6K cleaned GPT-4 conversations were retained for fine-tuning.

The cleaned GPT-4 conversations were combined with conversation templates and end-of-turn tokens, then cut to the context limit of the model (further content was simply discarded).

To run the data pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
./ochat/data/run_data_pipeline.sh INPUT_FOLDER OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

The input folder should contain a `ShareGPT` folder with `.html` files for each ShareGPT conversation page inside.

The data pipeline consists of three steps:

- Cleaning: HTML cleaning and conversion to Markdown, removing conversations with the wrong format, removing conversations with blocked words, and hash-based exact deduplication
- Filtering: Preserving only conversations marked as `Model: GPT-4`
- Converting: Converting and tokenizing all conversations for finetuning

**The final converted dataset follows the format:**

*MODEL_TYPE.train.json / .eval.json*

```
[
    [token_id_list, supervise_mask_list],
    [token_id_list, supervise_mask_list],
    ...
]
```

*MODEL_TYPE.train.text.json / .eval.text.json*

Plain text decoded from `token_id_list`

## Dataset visualization

We provide a tool for visualizing the embeddings of conversations. To use this tool, open `ochat/visualization/ui/visualizer.html` using a browser and drag `MODEL_TYPE.visualizer.json` into the webpage. Click on 3D plot points to show the corresponding conversation.

The embeddings are created using `openai_embeddings.py` to calculate embeddings of conversations, then UMAP dimension reduction and K-Means coloring with `dim_reduction.ipynb`.

## Training

The hyperparameters used in training the models are the same across all models:

| Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Length Grouping | Warmup Ratio | Weight decay |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 2e-5 | 5 | True | 0.03 | 0 |

To train using 8xA100 80GB:

```bash
NUM_GPUS=8

deepspeed --num_gpus=$NUM_GPUS --module ochat.training_deepspeed.train \
    --model_type MODEL_TYPE \
    --model_path BASE_MODEL_PATH \
    --save_path TARGET_FOLDER \
    --length_grouping \
    --epochs 5 \
    --data_path DATASET_PATH \
    --deepspeed \
    --deepspeed_config ochat/training_deepspeed/deepspeed_config.json

```

## Evaluation

The same routine as ChatGPT / GPT-4 was used to run other benchmarks or evaluations such as AlpacaEval. Simply run the API server and set the `openai.api_base` of the benchmark program.

To run the Vicuna GPT-4 evaluation, follow these steps:

1. Generate model answers

```bash
python -m ochat.evaluation.get_model_answer --model_type MODEL_TYPE --models_path PATH_CONTAINING_ALL_MODELS_SAME_TYPE --data_path ./ochat/evaluation/vicuna --output_path ./eval_results
```

2. Generate baseline (GPT-3.5) answers

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXX python -m ochat.evaluation.get_openai_answer --data_path ./ochat/evaluation/vicuna --output_path ./eval_baselines --model_types gpt-3.5-turbo
```

3. Run GPT-4 evaluation

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXX python -m ochat.evaluation.openai_eval --data_path ./ochat/evaluation/vicuna --baseline_path ./eval_baselines/vicuna_gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl --input_path ./eval_results
```

4. Visualize and plot

To visualize and plot the evaluation results, use `ochat/visualization/eval_result_ui/eval_result_visualizer.html`. Open the file using a browser and select all files inside `./eval_results/eval_result_YYYYMMDD` to show the results.

## Limitations

**Foundation Model Limitations**
Despite its advanced capabilities, OpenLLMs is still bound by the limitations inherent in its foundation models. These limitations may impact the model's performance in areas such as:

 - Complex reasoning
 - Mathematical and arithmetic tasks
 - Programming and coding challenges

**Hallucination of Non-existent Information**
OpenLLMs may sometimes generate information that does not exist or is not accurate, also known as "hallucination". Users should be aware of this possibility and verify any critical information obtained from the model.

## TODO

- [ ] Updating performance on more standard benchmarks
- [ ] Training larger LLaMA models
- [ ] Prepare the v3 version

## License

Our weight license is subject to their corresponding base model. For example, OpenChat and OpenChat-8192 are the same as the model [License](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md) of LLaMA for non-commercial use only, while OpenCoderPlus is under the [License](https://huggingface.co/blog/starcoder) of StarCoder. Furthermore, we should follow [Privacy Practices](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sharegpt-share-your-chatg/daiacboceoaocpibfodeljbdfacokfjb) of ShareGPT.
