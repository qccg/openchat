OpenChat is an innovative library of open-source language models, fine-tuned with [C-RLFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11235.pdf) - a strategy inspired by offline reinforcement learning. Our models learn from mixed-quality data without preference labels, delivering exceptional performance on par with ChatGPT, even with a 7B model. Despite our simple approach, we are committed to developing a high-performance, commercially viable, open-source large language model, and we continue to make significant strides toward this vision.

## <a id="models"></a> Models

Our latest model, OpenChat 3.5, is a highly capable model fine-tuned using C-RLFT with Mistral 7B as the base, on a collection of publicly available high-quality instruction data. For older version models such as OpenChat 3.2 SUPER, please refer to [Legacy Models](#legacy-models).

To use this model, we highly recommend installing the OpenChat package by following the [installation guide](#installation) and using the OpenChat OpenAI-compatible API server by running the serving command from the table below. The server is optimized for high-throughput deployment using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and can run on a consumer GPU with 24GB RAM. To enable tensor parallelism, append `--tensor-parallel-size N` to the serving command.

Once started, the server listens at `localhost:18888` for requests and is compatible with the [OpenAI ChatCompletion API specifications](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). Please refer to the example request below for reference. Additionally, you can use the [OpenChat Web UI](#web-ui) for a user-friendly experience.

If you want to deploy the server as an online service, you can use `--api-keys sk-KEY1 sk-KEY2 ...` to specify allowed API keys and `--disable-log-requests --disable-log-stats --log-file openchat.log` for logging only to a file. For security purposes, we recommend using an [HTTPS gateway](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/es/deployment/concepts/#security-https) in front of the server.

**: Open-source SOTA results are taken from reported results in instruction-tuned model papers and official repositories.

***: All zero-shot benchmarks follow the same setting as in the AGIEval paper and Orca paper. CoT tasks use the same configuration as Chain-of-Thought Hub, HumanEval is evaluated with EvalPlus, and MT-bench is run using FastChat. To reproduce our results, follow the instructions below.

<details>
  <summary>Reproducing benchmark results (click to expand)</summary>

Reasoning:

Note: Please run the following commands at the base directory of this repository.

```bash
python -m ochat.evaluation.run_eval --condition "GPT4 Correct" --model openchat/openchat_3.5
python ochat/evaluation/view_results.py
```

HumanEval:

Note: Please run the following commands at the base directory of this repository.

```bash
python -m ochat.evaluation.run_eval --condition "Code" --model openchat/openchat_3.5
python ochat/evaluation/convert_to_evalplus.py
```

Then all humaneval code samples are placed in `ochat/evaluation/evalplus_codegen`. Use the following command to evaluate an individual code sample named `samples.jsonl` using Docker as a sandbox.

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app ganler/evalplus:latest --dataset humaneval --samples samples.jsonl
```

MT-Bench:

Please first launch a local API server, then download FastChat and run the following commands.

Note: Due to non-zero temperature and GPT-4 API changes over time, there might be variations in the results.

```bash
cd fastchat/llm_judge
python gen_api_answer.py --model openchat_3.5 --max-tokens 4096 --parallel 128 --openai-api-base http://localhost:18888/v1
python gen_judgment.py --model-list openchat_3.5 --parallel 8 --mode single
```

</details>

## <a id="installation"></a> Installation

To use OpenChat, you need to install PyTorch, then you can install OpenChat via pip:

```bash
pip3 install ochat
```

If you encounter compatibility problems, you can try to create a new `conda` environment following the instructions below.

```bash
conda create -y --name openchat
conda activate openchat

conda install -y python=3.11
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio

pip3 install ochat
```

<details>
  <summary>In addition to PyPI, you can also install from source (click to expand)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat
cd openchat

pip3 install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip3 install -e .
```
</details>

## <a id="web-ui"></a> Web UI

After launching the API server, you can interact with it using [OpenChat-UI](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat-ui), which is a fork of Chatbot UI with support for OpenChat models.

To use OpenChat-UI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the OpenChat-UI repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat-ui.git
```

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Set the API host to the local server (or the address of the OpenChat server)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the OpenChat-UI repo with the following content:

```conf
OPENAI_API_HOST=http://localhost:18888
OPENAI_API_KEY=openchat-dummy-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE=0.5
```

4. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

## <a id="training"></a> OpenChat Model Training

The OpenChat training system utilizes padding-free training and the [Multipack Sampler](https://github.com/imoneoi/multipack_sampler), achieving a **3~10x** speedup compared to the conventional padded training.

## Choose a base model

OpenChat supports Llama 2 and Mistral models. Please first choose a base model to fit your needs. Each base model has a corresponding weight repo, model type, and recommended batch size as listed below, they should be filled into `BASE_REPO`, `MODEL_TYPE`, and `BATCH_SIZE` in the following instructions.

| Base Model | Size | Weights (with EOT token)          | Model Type              | Recommended Batch Size per GPU (8xA100 80GB) |
|------------|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Mistral    | 7B   | `imone/Mistral_7B_with_EOT_token` | `openchat_v3.2_mistral` | 83968                                |
| Llama 2    | 7B   | `imone/LLaMA2_7B_with_EOT_token`  | `openchat_v3.2`         | 83968                                |
| Llama 2    | 13B  | `imone/Llama2_13B_with_EOT_token` | `openchat_v3.2`         | 36864                                |

Note: The OpenChat conversation template requires an `<|end_of_turn|>` special token. The base model specified must include this token. Our provided weights are the original base weights with this token added. If you want to add them manually, use the `convert_llama_weights_to_hf_add_tokens.py` or `mistral_add_tokens.py` in the `scripts` directory.

## Installing DeepSpeed

First, ensure that the CUDA `nvcc` compiler is available in your environment. If it is not, install the CUDA toolkit that matches the version used by PyTorch.

Next, install DeepSpeed:

```bash
pip install deepspeed
```

### Preparing Your Data

To utilize the OpenChat trainer, prepare your SFT data into a JSON Lines format where each line corresponds to a `Conversation` object:

```python
class Message(BaseModel):
    role: str     # Must be "user" or "assistant"
    content: str  # Message content
    weight: Optional[float] = None  # Loss weight for this message. Typically 0 for user and 1 for assistant to supervise assistant's responses only


class Conversation(BaseModel):
    items: List[Message]  # All messages within the conversation
    condition: str = ""  # C-RLFT condition, can be any string or empty.
    system: str = ""  # System message for this conversation
```

For basic SFT, assign `weight` as `0` for human messages and `1` for assistant responses.

SFT example:

```json
{"items":[{"from":"user","content":"Hello","weight":0.0},{"from":"assistant","content":"Hi","weight":1.0},{"from":"user","content":"How are you today?","weight":0.0},{"from":"assistant","content":"I'm fine.","weight":1.0}],"system":""}
{"items":[{"from":"user","content":"Who are you?","weight":0.0},{"from":"assistant","content":"I'm OpenChat.","weight":1.0}],"system":"You are a helpful assistant named OpenChat."}
```

For C-RLFT, `condition` should be set as the class the conversation belongs to (e.g. `GPT3` or `GPT4`). The `weight` is assigned as `0` for human messages and `w` for assistant responses, where `w` is the weight of the class (e.g. `0.1` for `GPT3` and `1` for `GPT4`, as found in our C-RLFT paper).

C-RLFT example:

```json
{"items":[{"from":"user","content":"What is C-RLFT?","weight":0.0},{"from":"assistant","content":"C-RLFT is a method for improving open-source LLMs with mixed-quality data.","weight":1.0}],"condition":"GPT4","system":""}
{"items":[{"from":"user","content":"What is C-RLFT?","weight":0.0},{"from":"assistant","content":"I don't know.","weight":0.1}],"condition":"GPT3","system":""}
```

### Pre-tokenizing the Dataset

You'll then need to pre-tokenize the dataset using the command (please specify a filename as `PRETOKENIZED_DATA_OUTPUT_PATH` to store the pretokenized dataset):

```bash
python -m ochat.data.generate_dataset --model-type MODEL_TYPE --model-path BASE_REPO --in-files data.jsonl --out-prefix PRETOKENIZED_DATA_OUTPUT_PATH
```

### Launching the OpenChat Trainer

You can now launch the OpenChat trainer using the command below. Training a 13B model requires eight A/H100s with 80GB VRAM, while a 7B model can be trained with four A/H100s with 80GB VRAM or eight A/H100s with 40GB VRAM.

For hyperparameters, we recommend first setting the batch size to the recommended batch size. If OOM occurs, try setting it to the exact maximum that VRAM can hold and as a multiple of `2048`.
Other hyperparameters have been carefully selected as the default. Furthermore, the learning rate is automatically determined based on the [inverse square-root rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09092).

<details>

<summary>Training Commands (click to expand)</summary>

```bash
NUM_GPUS=8

deepspeed --num_gpus=$NUM_GPUS --module ochat.training_deepspeed.train \
          --model_path BASE_REPO \
          --data_prefix PRETOKENIZED_DATA_OUTPUT_PATH \
          --save_path PATH_TO_SAVE_MODEL \
          --batch_max_len BATCH_SIZE \
          --epochs 5 \
          --save_every 1 \
          --deepspeed \
          --deepspeed_config ochat/training_deepspeed/deepspeed_config.json
```

</details>

You can find checkpoints of all epochs in `PATH_TO_SAVE_MODEL`. Then you may evaluate each epoch and choose the best one.

## Limitations

**Foundation Model Limitations**
Despite its advanced capabilities, OpenChat is still bound by the limitations inherent in its foundation models. These limitations may impact the model's performance in areas such as:

 - Complex reasoning
 - Mathematical and arithmetic tasks
 - Programming and coding challenges

**Hallucination of Non-existent Information**
OpenChat may sometimes generate information that does not exist or is not accurate, also known as "hallucination". Users should be aware of this possibility and verify any critical information obtained from the model.

**Safety**
OpenChat may sometimes generate harmful, hate speech, biased responses, or answer unsafe questions. It's crucial to apply additional AI safety measures in use cases that require safe and moderated responses.

## License

Our OpenChat 3.5 code and models are distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

## <a id="legacy-models"></a> Legacy Models

The following models are older versions of OpenChat and have inferior performance compared to the latest version. They will be deprecated in the next release. Please note that OpenChat V1 and V2 series are now deprecated, [please install 3.1.x for using V1 and V2 models](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/83a683c775c77867cc45937fafdf48e8dcb68daa)

To run the models on multiple GPUs with smaller VRAM, you can enable tensor parallelization, for example, using the `--tensor-parallel-size 2` flag.
